This file is to outline the purpose of this app and how to get set up

- make sure you have downloaded all relevant packages
- do this by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your Terminal on the Jira_Analyser folder


App Usage
This code is designed to show you a rolling window of the last 12 months of completed jiras,
get each jira's cycle time and combine them for a monthly average,
then display a graph showing your average trend in monthly jira cycle times


To Use

Configure User, Token and Server
To configure this app to run you have to change the user and token in the user_config.json file
The server should already be set to Workday's Jira server
Get your Personal Access Token by generating it in Jira
If you don't know how to create your token follow this guide: https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html
if you want to be able to view a cycle time breakdown for an epic, enter that epic's Jira ID in the config file as well

 "config": {
        "user":"firstname.lastname",
        "token":"<String of Random Characters>",
        "server": "https://jira2.companyname.com",
        "epic": "<Epic Jira ID i.e. "Jira-1234">"
    }

Now run the program
A menu should appear with two buttons, once you click a button navigate back to the terminal to see your result
This will take a few moments.
The terminal should begin receiving results, if it takes to long to respond, cancel the run, wait a minute and run it again
If it fails unexpectedly and throws jira related errors then run it again. Otherwise check teh configurations are set correctly.
